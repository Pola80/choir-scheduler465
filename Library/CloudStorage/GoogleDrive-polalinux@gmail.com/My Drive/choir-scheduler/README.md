Choir Scheduler — Expo React Native starter

What this is
- A small starter mobile app to schedule choir rehearsals (create, list, view, delete).

Run locally
1. Install dependencies (requires Node.js and npm/yarn and Expo CLI):

```powershell
cd %USERPROFILE%\Desktop\choir-scheduler
npm install
npx expo start
```

2. Use the Expo Go app on a phone or emulator to load the project.

Notes
- Storage uses AsyncStorage and persists on the device/emulator.
- This is a minimal starter: add authentication, calendar integration, notifications, and backend sync as needed.
